# Core Objects v0

ClisTa preserves reasoning transitions as structured objects.

## Thread

The container for a reasoning question.

## Thread Fork

A divergent reasoning thread that inherits parent thread state through a declared event boundary.

## Merge Request

A governed request to integrate fork reasoning into an ancestor thread without erasing dissent.

## Merge Review

A governance response to a merge request.

## Merge Conflict

A declared incompatibility between parent reasoning and fork reasoning.

## Merge Completion

The immutable record of accepted, rejected, and preserved fork reasoning after merge governance succeeds.

## Participant

A human, agent, tool, or system actor with a declared role.

## Evidence

An immutable sourced finding committed to a thread.

## Assumption

A declared premise that claims or decisions depend on.

Many disagreements are assumption disagreements rather than evidence disagreements.

## Claim

An interpretation or assertion built from evidence and assumptions.

## Position

A participant stance toward a claim, decision request, or thread.

## Objection

A structured challenge to evidence, an assumption, a claim, a position, or a decision request.

## Decision Request

A proposal to update accepted reasoning state.

It is the ClisTa equivalent of a pull request.

## Review

A governance response to a decision request.

Examples include approval, approval with conditions, request changes, rejection, or comment.

## Decision Record

The immutable record of an accepted or rejected decision.

## Expected Outcome

A measurable expectation attached to a decision record before reality is known.

## Minority Report

Preserved dissent attached to a decision record.

## Outcome Audit

A later comparison between the decision and reality.

## Decision Score

An empirical quality score derived from outcome audits.

## Contribution Attribution

A derived or explicit record that binds a reasoning contribution to participant identity, role context, authority context, and source event.

## Contribution Provenance

A derived source-lineage record for a reasoning contribution.

It records source type, source id, introducing event, transformation, source hash where available, and whether the source was available at contribution event time.

Provenance does not score truth. It keeps the audit trail neutral.

## Learning Signal

A pattern-level observation derived from outcome evidence.

It may reference contributions, outcomes, provenance, and governance objects.

It must not assign participant scores, source scores, model rankings, or authority changes.

## Learning Pattern

A projected grouping of learning signals by reasoning pattern.

It describes a repeatable reasoning pattern, not a participant, source, agent, model, or institution.

## Learning Recommendation

A non-authoritative revisit suggestion derived from learning signals.

It may recommend future review. It must not mutate governance authority automatically.

## Adaptation Recommendation

A non-authoritative governance review recommendation derived from learning signals.

It may recommend review of evidence requirements, revisit triggers, decision gates, governance audit requirements, outcome windows, provenance completeness, or objection-resolution requirements.

It must not change authority, decision rules, governance thresholds, participant standing, source trust, or model preference.

## Adaptation Review

An explicit record that a governance adaptation recommendation was reviewed.

It preserves auditability without applying the governance change. Actual protocol or governance changes still require authorized governance events.

## Protocol Amendment

An explicit proposed change to protocol rules, governance requirements, evidence thresholds, revisit triggers, decision gates, schemas, or validation policies.

An amendment may reference learning signals and adaptation recommendations as rationale. Those references do not make it active.

Only an approved amendment is active. Rejected amendments and superseded amendments remain in history without changing active protocol state.

## Protocol Amendment Review

A recorded review of an amendment rationale.

It may support, reject, request changes, or comment on the amendment, but it does not make the amendment active.

## Protocol Amendment Approval

An authorized governance action that makes an amendment active for future validation or governance behavior.

Approval must be explicit and authority-validated. It must not rewrite past event validity.

## Protocol Amendment Rejection

An authorized governance action that rejects an amendment.

Rejected amendments do not alter active protocol state.

## Protocol Amendment Supersession

An authorized governance action that deactivates a previously approved amendment while preserving its history.

## Continuity Packet

A portable verification artifact for projected reasoning state.

It carries source events, event-log integrity proof, projected-state checksums, milestone capability set, verification state, and resume status.

It is not a transcript, not model memory, not governance approval, and not a new authority source.

## Continuity Verification State

A deterministic record of whether transferred reasoning state is `verified`, `degraded`, or `rejected`.

It records required verification layers for integrity, attribution, provenance, learning, adaptation, amendments, and compatibility.
M16 adds interoperability verification status so a resumed packet records whether protocol meaning can survive exchange.
M17 adds federation verification status so exchanged state can be referenced without importing remote authority.
M18 adds negotiation verification status so exchanged state can declare unresolved differences and exchange terms without transferring authority.
M19 adds delegation verification status so scoped action can be authorized without surrendering authority.

## Compatibility Context

A deterministic declaration of the local protocol version, capability set, supported verification layers, supported continuity packet versions, and supported amendment types.

It is not governance approval and does not mutate imported state.

## Compatibility Check

A verification result that classifies a continuity packet as `compatible`, `degraded`, `incompatible`, or `rejected` for a specific receiving context.

Unsupported required capabilities or unsupported active amendments fail closed.

## Interoperability Profile

A deterministic declaration of exchange format, required semantics, optional semantics, supported event types, and protocol object meanings.

It is not a transcript summary, not source reputation, not participant scoring, and not structural acceptance.

## Semantic Mapping

An explicit mapping from one declared protocol semantic to the same semantic in another compatible context.

Translation must preserve meaning. A semantic mapping cannot reinterpret authority, provenance, learning signals, adaptation recommendations, amendments, continuity, or compatibility as plain metadata.

## Interoperability Check

A verification result that classifies a continuity packet as `interoperable`, `degraded`, `incompatible`, or `rejected` for a specific semantic profile.

Unknown required semantics, unsupported event meanings, or changed protocol object meanings fail closed. Optional unsupported semantics may degrade only when the degradation is explicit.

## Federation Context

A declared independent ClisTa context that may exchange verified reasoning state under shared protocol rules.

It is not a shared authority domain.

## Federation Peer

A recorded external context identity used for audit references.

Peer identity does not make remote participants, roles, authorities, amendments, or governance rules local.

## Federated State Reference

A local append-only reference to a verified external continuity/interoperability packet.

It records packet hash, event-log hash, projection hash, state hash, remote thread id, compatibility status, interoperability status, and federation status.

## Federation Boundary

An explicit record that remote state may inform local reasoning but cannot mutate local governance, import authority, import amendments, or create consensus automatically.

## Negotiation Request

A request to compare or resolve exchange terms between independent ClisTa contexts.

It is not authority transfer and does not create shared governance.

## Negotiation Constraint

A declared local or remote constraint on exchange terms, such as required capabilities, validation requirements, supported amendments, semantic mappings, or review conditions.

Constraints may limit exchange. They do not mutate governance rules.

## Negotiation Difference

An explicit record of a capability, amendment, validation requirement, interoperability profile, compatibility status, interoperability status, or federation status difference.

Differences must be declared rather than silently downgraded.

## Negotiation Terms

Proposed, accepted, rejected, or degraded exchange terms for referencing or sharing reasoning state.

Accepted terms may constrain exchange behavior. They do not import authority, adopt amendments, merge governance, mutate local state, or create consensus.

## Negotiation Failure

A record that exchange terms could not be agreed under declared constraints.

Failure preserves the audit trail without rejecting the underlying local reasoning state.

## Delegation Grant

A scoped authorization from an accountable delegator to a delegate actor.

It records the action, scope, limits, required delegator authority, expiration, and attribution requirement.

Delegation grants action permission. They do not transfer underlying authority.

M19.1 requires every delegate type to resolve to a known participant. Delegate type describes the participant boundary; it does not bypass actor identity.

## Delegated Action

An action performed under a delegation grant.

It records the delegate, grant, action, scope, target, summary, and attribution back to the delegation.

Delegated actions must stay within the granted scope.

The recording actor must be the accountable delegate participant.

## Delegation Revocation

A record that a delegation grant no longer permits action.

Revocation preserves the grant history while preventing future delegated action.

## Delegation Expiration

A record that a delegation grant ended under declared expiration conditions.

Expiration does not mutate the original grant.

## Delegation Violation

A record that a delegated action exceeded or attempted to exceed its scope.

Violation preserves accountability without expanding delegate authority.
