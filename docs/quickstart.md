# ClisTa Quickstart

This guide is for a fresh local checkout. It proves the released artifact is usable without relying on roadmap-thread context.

```text
release_quickstart = reproduce(first_successful_workflow, from_docs_alone)
documented release != usable release
```

## Prerequisite

ClisTa runs on Node.js 18 or newer.

```sh
node --version
```

## Setup

```sh
git clone https://github.com/lati-cooki/clista-protocol.git
cd clista-protocol
npm install
```

Run the CLI from the checkout with:

```sh
npm run clista -- help
```

When ClisTa is installed as a `clista` binary, the same commands can be run without `npm run clista --`.

## First Successful Workflow

Run these commands from the repository root:

```sh
npm run clista -- validate
npm run clista -- state show
npm run clista -- export
npm run clista -- continuity export --out continuity.json
npm run clista -- continuity verify --packet continuity.json
npm run clista -- release verify
```

This is the minimum release usage path:

1. Validate the append-only event log.
2. Reconstruct projected reasoning state.
3. Export portable protocol state.
4. Produce a continuity packet.
5. Verify the continuity packet.
6. Verify the release artifact.

## Reading Success

`validate` succeeds when it returns:

```json
{
  "valid": true,
  "errors": []
}
```

This means the event log passed protocol validation. It does not mean every claim is true or that every decision is wise.

`state show` succeeds when it prints JSON reasoning state. This proves projected state can be reconstructed from the append-only event log. It does not mean the transcript itself is memory or authority.

`export` succeeds when it prints JSON with `schema: "clista.protocol.v0"` and an `events` collection. This makes projected state portable. It does not grant trust, governance, or approval.

`continuity verify` succeeds when it returns `valid: true`. A result such as `resumeStatus: "degraded"` can still be valid; it means the packet is accepted under an explicit compatibility mode rather than strict continuity.

`release verify` succeeds when it returns `valid: true` and `releaseVerified: true`. It binds source, Git tag, package version, CLI entrypoint, schema hashes, source hashes, verifier results, and export expectations.

## Reading Failures

| Failure | Meaning | Inspect next | Likely next command |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Missing file | The command was given a path that does not exist. | Current directory and the path argument. | `pwd` then rerun with the corrected path. |
| Missing required option | The command needs a required flag. | The command usage line. | `npm run clista -- help` |
| Validation failure | The event log is not trusted protocol state. | Returned `event_id`, `event_type`, and `reason`. | `npm run clista -- validate --events <path>` |
| Integrity failure | Event hashes or chain links do not match. | Integrity reasons and head hash. | `npm run clista -- integrity verify --events <path>` |
| Continuity degraded | The packet is valid only under explicit compatibility mode. | `verificationMode`, `resumeStatus`, and `reasons`. | `npm run clista -- continuity verify --packet continuity.json` |
| Release manifest missing | The manifest path is absent. | The manifest path or whether a manifest should be generated. | `npm run clista -- release manifest --out .clista/release-manifest.json` |
| Release verify failed | Manifest, source, tag, package, hash, verifier, or boundary checks failed. | `reasons` and `violations`. | `npm run clista -- release verify` |
| Package/tag/version mismatch | `package.json` version and release tag version disagree, or the tag points to a different commit. | `package.json`, `git tag`, and `git rev-parse HEAD`. | `npm run clista -- release verify --tag <tag>` |

## Release Verification Boundary

Release exists does not mean release is trusted.

`clista release verify` proves that the repository artifact matches the release manifest. It keeps these fields false by design:

```text
trusted
protocolAuthority
governanceApproval
amendmentApproval
compatibilityProof
```

Release verification does not create protocol authority, approve governance, approve amendments, publish trust, or prove compatibility by itself.

## Release Versus Reasoning State

M25 release manifests are repository artifacts, not append-only reasoning events.

`state show` and `export` may omit release state by design. This preserves the core law:

```text
Conversation is input.
Reasoning state is output.
```

Release verification proves the artifact boundary. Reasoning state still comes from the event log and deterministic projection.

## Continuity Version Versus Package Version

Continuity may report:

```json
{
  "protocolVersion": "0.24.0"
}
```

while `package.json` reports `0.25.0` or a later `0.25.x` cleanup release.

That is expected. Continuity reflects the latest reasoning-state portability boundary. Package and release versions reflect repository artifact releases. M25 verifies the release artifact; it does not add a new continuity state layer.
