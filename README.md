# ClisTa Protocol

Here’s a yes — now trace its shape.

ClisTa changes the shape of yes.

A normal decision system records:

```text
approved / rejected
```

ClisTa records an accountable decision state:

- evidence carried into the decision
- assumptions that shaped the decision
- objections that survived approval
- minority reports
- authority trails
- provenance traces
- bounded scope
- verification state
- proceed / blocked / degraded status

In the M27 scenario replay, the limited beta approval was not a boolean. It was a yes with its accountability structure fused on:

- 4 evidence items
- 2 assumptions
- 3 claims
- a privacy objection that survived the yes
- 2 governance reviews
- a minority report
- a provenance trace
- authority context
- bounded scope: redacted sample tickets only

That is the product value of the protocol: ClisTa turns raw decisions into accountable state. It does not just record that a decision was made. It records the shape that made the decision accountable.

```text
conversation -> event log -> projection -> verification -> accountable state
```

Operating law:

```text
Conversation is input.
Reasoning state is output.
```

## Quickstart

Prerequisite:

```text
Node.js >=18
```

Clone and run from a local checkout:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/lati-club/clista-protocol.git
cd clista-protocol
npm install
```

Use the local CLI through the package script:

```sh
npm run clista -- help
```

First successful workflow:

```sh
npm run clista -- validate
npm run clista -- state show
npm run clista -- export
npm run clista -- continuity export --out continuity.json
npm run clista -- continuity verify --packet continuity.json
npm run clista -- release verify --tag v0.30.1-protocol-release
npm run clista -- release manifest --out .clista/release-manifest.json --tag v0.30.1-protocol-release
npm run clista -- runtime verify --manifest .clista/release-manifest.json
npm run clista -- runtime audit --manifest .clista/release-manifest.json
```

Expected outcomes on a fresh clone: every command above exits 0. The two continuity steps
report `resumeStatus: "degraded"` — the bundled origin thread predates v0.24 — and list the
legacy causes in `degradationReasons`. Degraded continuity on this fixture is the documented
boundary, not a broken install.

Run the scenario demo to inspect the yes shape directly:

```sh
node src/cli.js validate --events examples/scenario-demo/events.ndjson
node src/cli.js state show --thread thd_scenario_demo --events examples/scenario-demo/events.ndjson
node src/cli.js export --events examples/scenario-demo/events.ndjson
node src/cli.js attribution list --thread thd_scenario_demo --events examples/scenario-demo/events.ndjson
node src/cli.js provenance trace dcr_limited_beta --events examples/scenario-demo/events.ndjson
```

Inspect `examples/scenario-demo/expected-state.json` manually for the compact expected decision, evidence, assumptions, claims, positions, objection, reviews, and minority report. M29 does not add a comparator command.

## What This Proves

The M27 scenario demo lives in `examples/scenario-demo/`. It uses existing `validate`, `state show`, `export`, `attribution list`, and `provenance trace` commands to make one realistic reasoning lifecycle understandable from its event fixture.

M28 audits that the same scenario can be replayed from a clean public checkout without hidden builder state, unpublished files, absolute local paths, or mutation of unrelated `.clista` state.

M29 is a product narrative pass over existing documentation. It does not add protocol behavior. It makes the public explanation match the verified artifact: a replayable decision state whose evidence, assumptions, objections, minority reports, authority context, and provenance can be traced.

## Success Means

| Command | Success means | Success does not mean |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `validate` | The append-only event log passed validator checks. | Every claim is true or wise. |
| `state show` | ClisTa reconstructed reasoning state from events. | The transcript is memory or authority. |
| `export` | Projected protocol state can be serialized for portability. | The export grants trust, governance, or approval. |
| `continuity verify` | A continuity packet matches its event log, projection, state hash, and required verification layers. | Context transfer is trusted memory or central authority. |
| `release verify` | The release artifact binds source, tag, package version, CLI, schema, hashes, and verifier results. | The release is trusted, approved, compatible by itself, or authorized as governance. |
| `runtime verify` | The local runtime matches an existing release manifest. | Running ClisTa is trust, OS attestation, CI trust, or remote runtime trust. |
| `runtime audit` | The documented runtime verification path is discoverable, executable, clear, and bounded. | Verified runtime is trust, protocol authority, governance approval, amendment approval, or compatibility proof. |
| Scenario demo commands | A realistic fixture can be validated, projected, exported, and inspected as durable reasoning state from repo-relative public files. | The demo is a product platform, distribution proof, installation proof, UI, agents, trust, governance approval, amendment approval, compatibility proof, or protocol authority. |

## Failure Triage

| Failure | What it means | Inspect next | Likely next command |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Missing file | A path argument points to a file that does not exist. | The path and current directory. | `pwd` then rerun with the correct `--events`, `--packet`, or `--manifest` path. |
| Missing required option | A command needs another flag. | `npm run clista -- help` for the command shape. | Rerun with the missing `--<option>`. |
| Validation failure | The event log is not trusted protocol state. | The returned `event_id`, `event_type`, and `reason`. | `npm run clista -- validate --events <path>` |
| Integrity failure | Hashes or event-chain evidence do not match. | Integrity reasons and the event log head. | `npm run clista -- integrity verify --events <path>` |
| Continuity degraded | The packet is valid but not strict for the current boundary. | `verificationMode`, `resumeStatus`, and `degradationReasons`. | `npm run clista -- continuity verify --packet continuity.json` |
| Release manifest missing | A supplied manifest path is absent. | The manifest path or whether one should be generated. | `npm run clista -- release manifest --out .clista/release-manifest.json` |
| Release verify failed | The release artifact does not match its manifest or boundary rules. | `reasons` and `violations`. | `npm run clista -- release verify --tag v0.30.1-protocol-release` |
| Package/tag/version mismatch | `package.json` version and the release tag disagree, or the tag points elsewhere. | `package.json`, `git tag`, and `git rev-parse HEAD`. | `npm run clista -- release verify --tag <tag>` |
| Runtime verify failed | The current runtime drifted from the supplied manifest. | `drift`, `warnings`, and `violations`. | `npm run clista -- runtime verify --manifest .clista/release-manifest.json` |
| Runtime audit failed | The documented runtime verification path is missing, unclear, not executable, or overclaims. | `checks` and `violations`. | `npm run clista -- runtime audit --manifest .clista/release-manifest.json` |

## Protocol Spine

- Append-only NDJSON event log.
- Event log as source of truth.
- Projected state derived from events.
- CLI-first protocol engine.

The compressed M0-M25 primitive map is:

```text
docs/protocol/v0/primitive-map.md
```

The critical command is:

```text
clista state show
```

If it can reconstruct the current reasoning state from only the append-only log, the protocol spine works.

The validity command is:

```text
clista validate
```

If it rejects invalid event logs with clear event-level errors, the protocol can govern reasoning state instead of merely projecting it.

The integrity command is:

```text
clista integrity verify
```

If it verifies canonical hashes, the event log can be trusted as history rather than just read as data.

For v0.6 chained logs, add `--strict` to require protocol versions, hash versions, and previous-hash links.

The continuity command is:

```text
clista continuity export --out continuity.json
clista continuity resume --packet continuity.json
```

If it produces and resumes a verifiable Continuity Packet, projected reasoning state can survive context loss without treating the transcript as memory.

The compatibility command is:

```text
clista compatibility verify --packet continuity.json
```

If it verifies the packet against the local protocol capability set, required verification layers, and active amendment support, portable reasoning can fail closed instead of relying on best effort acceptance.

The interoperability command is:

```text
clista interoperability verify --packet continuity.json
```

If it verifies declared semantics, event meanings, and object meanings, portable reasoning can preserve protocol meaning instead of merely matching packet structure.

The federation command is:

```text
clista federation verify
```

If it verifies external state references without importing remote authority, independent ClisTa contexts can align without centralizing governance.

The negotiation command is:

```text
clista negotiation verify
```

If it verifies exchange terms without authority transfer, independent ClisTa contexts can resolve differences without merging governance.

The execution command is:

```text
clista execution verify
```

If it verifies performed action with evidence under authorized scope and constraints, execution can be trusted without treating intent as completion.

The outcome command is:

```text
clista outcome verify
```

If it verifies observed effect against intended effect with evidence, completed execution can be evaluated without treating completion as success.

Terminology note: M3 decision outcomes compare a decision's declared expected consequence against later audits for decision scoring. M21 protocol outcomes evaluate an execution-linked observed effect against its intended effect. The CLI namespace overlaps, but the event families are distinct.

The outcome-learning command is:

```text
clista outcome-learning verify
```

If it verifies lessons derived from evaluated outcomes without rewriting prior reasoning, the protocol can improve without retroactive justification.

`clista outcome-learning derive` accepts optional `--evidence`. When omitted, the learning signal uses the latest outcome evaluation evidence. `clista outcome-learning lesson` also accepts optional `--evidence`; when omitted, the lesson uses the source signal evidence. Read-only outcome-learning commands accept `--events <path>` for fixture and export inspection.

The protocol review command is:

```text
clista review verify
```

If it verifies required review routing without treating review as approval, state changes that require examination can be held for review without mutating governance, authority, recovery, rollback, accountability, or the reviewed object.

M23 review commands are distinct from `clista review submit`, which remains the M3 decision-review command for decision requests.

The protocol recovery command is:

```text
clista recovery verify
```

If it verifies reviewed recovery records without rewriting history, ClisTa can quarantine unsafe subjects and restore recovery-aware trusted projection while keeping invalid history visible and auditable.

M24 recovery commands append recovery records only. Recovery is not approval, amendment, consensus, governance mutation, authority creation, rollback, or event replacement.

The protocol release command is:

```text
clista release verify
```

If it verifies a release manifest, ClisTa can bind package version, Git commit, Git tag, CLI entrypoint, schema hashes, source hashes, capability declarations, verifier results, and export shape without treating the release itself as trust.

M25 release manifests are repository artifacts, not reasoning-state events. Release is not trust, protocol authority, governance approval, amendment approval, publishing verification, or compatibility proof by itself.

The protocol runtime command is:

```text
clista runtime verify --manifest .clista/release-manifest.json
```

If it verifies the local execution environment against an existing release manifest, ClisTa can detect runtime drift without treating running code as verified by default.

M26 runtime verification is not trust, protocol authority, governance approval, amendment approval, compatibility proof, package publishing trust, OS security attestation, CI trust, or remote runtime trust. It does not mutate the event log or projected reasoning state.

The runtime usage audit command is:

```text
clista runtime audit --manifest .clista/release-manifest.json
```

If it verifies the documented path, ClisTa can show that runtime verification is discoverable and bounded for a fresh user. M26.1 runtime usage audit is not trusted release status, runtime trust, protocol authority, governance approval, amendment approval, compatibility proof, or M27.

The protocol scenario demo is:

```text
examples/scenario-demo/
```

Run it with:

```text
clista validate --events examples/scenario-demo/events.ndjson
clista state show --thread thd_scenario_demo --events examples/scenario-demo/events.ndjson
clista export --events examples/scenario-demo/events.ndjson
```

If it validates, projects, and exports, ClisTa can show one realistic reasoning lifecycle as durable state. M27 scenario/demo workflow is not protocol distribution, artifact installation, product readiness, UI, agents, trust, protocol authority, governance approval, amendment approval, or compatibility proof.

The external replay audit is:

```text
examples/scenario-demo/
```

Run the documented scenario commands from a clean public checkout, then inspect:

```text
clista attribution list --thread thd_scenario_demo --events examples/scenario-demo/events.ndjson
clista provenance trace dcr_limited_beta --events examples/scenario-demo/events.ndjson
```

If the scenario can be found, validated, projected, exported, manually compared with expected state, and inspected for attribution/provenance without hidden builder state or absolute local paths, ClisTa has proven M28 external replay for this scenario. M28 external replay audit does not add an expected-state comparator command, and is not installation, distribution, network behavior, UI, agents, external user testing, product readiness, trust, protocol authority, governance approval, amendment approval, or compatibility proof.

The product narrative pass is:

```text
docs/protocol/v0/milestone-29.md
```

If the README leads with the yes shape, uses the existing scenario as proof, and keeps boundaries after the affirmative explanation, ClisTa can explain its verified artifact without changing protocol behavior.

The identity command is:

```text
clista identity show --participant par_troy
```

If it reconstructs roles, active authority, revoked authority, and authority history from the event log, portable reasoning stays accountable after it leaves its original context.

The attribution command is:

```text
clista attribution list
```

If it traces claims, assumptions, evidence, objections, decisions, outcomes, forks, merges, and governance reviews back to participants and event-time authority context, reasoning contributions are accountable without becoming reputation.

The provenance command is:

```text
clista provenance verify
```

If it verifies where each contribution came from, what transformation introduced it, and whether source lineage was available at contribution time, accountability becomes auditability without becoming scoring.

The learning command is:

```text
clista learning review
```

If it derives pattern-level learning signals from outcomes without ranking participants, sources, agents, or models, reasoning can improve without becoming reputation.

The adaptation command is:

```text
clista adaptation review
```

If it recommends governance review from learning signals without changing authority, rules, gates, or thresholds, governance can adapt without becoming hidden mutation.

The amendment command is:

```text
clista amendment verify
```

If it verifies explicit approved protocol changes without treating recommendations as amendments, governance can authorize improvement without implicit mutation.

## Boundaries

Release exists does not mean release is trusted. `clista release verify` keeps `trusted: false` by design and does not create protocol authority, governance approval, amendment approval, publishing verification, or compatibility proof.

Runtime verification requires an existing release manifest. It does not silently generate a fresh manifest, because generated proof can describe the current drifted runtime. Documented first-run artifacts such as `continuity.json` and `package-lock.json` are not runtime identity. `clista runtime verify` keeps `trusted: false` by design and does not create protocol authority, governance approval, amendment approval, compatibility proof, package publishing trust, OS attestation, CI trust, or remote runtime trust.

Runtime usage audit checks whether a fresh user can follow the documented path to runtime verification without insider context. `clista runtime audit` does not create trusted release status, runtime trust, protocol authority, governance approval, amendment approval, compatibility proof, or any new reasoning-state record.

M25 release manifests are repository artifacts, not reasoning-state events. `state show` and `export` may omit release state by design: conversation is input, reasoning state is output, and release verification proves the artifact boundary rather than the conversation state.

Continuity may report `protocolVersion: "0.24.0"` while the package release is `0.25.0` or a later artifact release such as `0.29.0`. Continuity reflects the latest reasoning-state portability boundary; the package version reflects the current released artifact. M25 binds the package artifact, M26 verifies the local runtime, M26.1 audits runtime verification usability, M27 adds a documented scenario fixture, M28 audits external replay of that fixture, and M29 changes product narrative documentation without adding a new continuity state layer.

Anti-pattern:

```text
vibes with hashes
```

A system that hashes artifacts without proving who authored them, what authority they carried, or why their contributions should be trusted.

Provenance is not truth ranking. It records source lineage; it does not score sources, participants, or models.

Learning is not reputation. It updates reasoning patterns from outcome evidence; it does not change participant authority or assign trust scores.

Adaptation is not governance mutation. It recommends authorized review; it does not execute governance changes.

Recommendation is not amendment. Amendments require explicit approval by active governance authority.

Continuity is not transcript replay. A resumed thread is trusted because projected state verifies, not because a model remembers the conversation.

Compatibility is not best effort acceptance. Unsupported state is not valid state.

Interoperability is not semantic loss. Translation is not reinterpretation.

Federation is not centralization. Shared state is not shared authority.

Negotiation is not authority transfer. Agreement is not governance merger.

Delegation is not authority surrender. Delegated action is scoped and attributable.

Non-participant delegation is not actor exemption. Every delegate that records action resolves to an accountable participant.

Execution is not intent. Completion requires evidence that the authorized action was performed under verified scope and constraints.

Completion is not success. Outcome evidence must satisfy the intended effect before performed action can be evaluated as successful.

Learning is not retroactive justification. Lessons can derive from evaluated outcomes, but they cannot rewrite prior rationale, intended effect, governance, or authority.

Review is not approval. Required review routes state changes through examination before further action; it does not approve, repair, recover, roll back, score accountability, create authority, create consensus, or mutate the reviewed state.

Recovery is not history rewrite. It can restore trusted projection membership from verified checkpoints and repair records, but it cannot delete, replace, hide, or normalize invalid events.

Layer versions are capability boundaries, not release numbers. A cleanup or documentation release can advance the package or tag version while unchanged layers keep the protocol version where that capability was introduced.

The export schema describes projected protocol state. The validator is the strict trust contract for event logs.

## Repository Boundary

This repository is `clista-protocol`.

It is not `clista-app`, `clista-ui`, or `clista-platform`.

Do not build UI, agent orchestration, graph databases, governance portals, or platform features until the protocol spine works.

## Run the Debate Pack on Your Own Decision

`pack/` is the distributable Stage 0 debate pack: `PROMPT_PACK.md` (roles, rules, close
protocol), `LEDGER_TEMPLATE.md` (the artifact of record), and `RUNBOOK.md` (how to run an
instrumented external run and where to report it). It works with AI agents from any vendor,
humans, or both. External runs feed a public, bidirectional gate (`pack/GATES.md`): if five
external runs don't materialize by 2026-09-07, or runs show no advantage, the productization
claim dies on the record. Failed and abandoned runs are explicitly wanted evidence.
