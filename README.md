# ClisTa Protocol

Here's a yes — now trace its shape.

A normal decision system records:

```text
approved / rejected
```

ClisTa records an accountable decision state:

- evidence carried into the decision
- assumptions that shaped it
- objections that survived approval
- minority reports
- authority trails
- provenance traces
- bounded scope and verification state

In the bundled scenario, a team approves an AI support-assistant beta. The approval is not a
boolean. It is a yes with its accountability structure fused on: 4 evidence items, 2
assumptions, 3 claims, a privacy objection that survived the yes, 2 governance reviews, a
minority report, a provenance trace, authority context — and a scope *narrower than the
question asked*: redacted sample tickets only.

That is the product value: ClisTa does not just record that a decision was made. It records
the shape that made the decision accountable — and anyone holding the event log can
reconstruct that shape.

```text
conversation -> event log -> projection -> verification -> accountable state
```

Operating law: **conversation is input; reasoning state is output.**

## Start here — run an external debate (this is the only deadline)

ClisTa's productization claim sits on a public, bidirectional gate: **five external
debate-pack runs by 2026-09-07, or the claim dies on the record** (`pack/GATES.md`). An
"external run" is a team we did not prompt, host, or grade, running the pack on their own
real decision in their own harness. Running one is the single highest-impact thing a
visitor can do here — it moves this project more than any code change, because the format's
own debate ruled that further clean closures *by us* confirm nothing.

You can go from here to a reportable run in under an hour:

1. **Get the pack.** `pack/PROMPT_PACK.md` (roles, rules, close protocol),
   `pack/LEDGER_TEMPLATE.md` (the artifact of record), `pack/RUNBOOK.md` (how to run and
   where to report). Works with AI agents from any vendor, humans, or both. No tooling
   required — one markdown ledger is the whole artifact.
2. **Pick a real decision** that passes the applicability check in `PROMPT_PACK.md` (hard
   to reverse, multi-party or multi-session, claims checkable against real artifacts).
3. **Run the rounds and keep the ledger.** Capture `failures.md` and `cost.md` alongside
   it — that instrumentation is what makes the run count (`pack/RUNBOOK.md`).
4. **Report it.** Easiest — no software needed:
   [**open a prefilled report issue**](https://github.com/lati-club/clista-protocol/issues/new?title=External%20run%20report%3A%20%3Cdecision%20title%3E&body=%3C%21--%20ClisTa%20external%20debate-pack%20run.%20Edit%20%3Cdecision%20title%3E%20in%20the%20issue%20title%20above.%20--%3E%0A%0AThis%20run%20was%20NOT%20prompted%2C%20hosted%2C%20refereed%2C%20or%20graded%20by%20the%20ClisTa%20project.%0Aepistemic_state%3A%20unaudited%20%E2%80%94%20a%20clean%20closure%20means%20well-shaped%2C%20not%20right.%0A%0A%23%23%20Artifacts%20%28attach%20or%20link%29%0A-%20%5B%20%5D%20LEDGER.md%20%E2%80%94%20closure_state%3A%20closed%2C%20every%20row%20terminal%2C%20Transfer%20State%20filled%0A-%20%5B%20%5D%20failures.md%20%E2%80%94%20discipline%20failures%20observed%20%28or%20%22none%20observed%22%29%0A-%20%5B%20%5D%20cost.md%20%E2%80%94%20wall-clock%2C%20rounds%2C%20tokens%2C%20human-minutes%20of%20format%20overhead%0A-%20%5B%20%5D%20outcome.md%20%E2%80%94%20later%2C%20if%20the%20decision%20gets%20executed%0A%0A%23%23%20One-line%20integrity%20verdict%0AWas%20the%20debate%20real%3F%0A)
   (the title and an artifact checklist are filled in for you), then attach `LEDGER.md`,
   `failures.md`, and `cost.md`. Or email them to `lati@clista.ai`.

   *Optional, only if you captured the run as a ClisTa event log:*
   `npm install && npm run clista -- run report --events <your-run>.ndjson --out submission.json`
   validates the log, writes a portable `submission.json`, and prints the same reporting link.
   It fails closed on an invalid log and keeps `trusted: false`.

**Failed and abandoned runs are wanted evidence** — a run that exposes the format is worth
more than one that flatters it. Nothing here becomes trusted by running it: verification of
structure is never endorsement of content, and only blind external judging
(`docs/judging.md`) decides whether a run counts toward the gate.

Everything below is the protocol tour — what the engine is, and how to verify it yourself.

## Try It in 30 Seconds

Prerequisite: Node.js >= 18. Nothing to install — the engine has zero dependencies.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/lati-club/clista-protocol.git
cd clista-protocol
npm run replay
```

This reproduces the bundled agent-session example in a clean room and verifies it end to
end: it re-ingests a session into a canonical event log, confirms the result is
byte-identical to the committed one, validates it against the engine, and prints the
decision answer view — *what was decided, why, who dissented, what should happen next*. It
ends with `Clean-room replay PASSED`. No server, no account, no setup — the event log is the
source of truth.

## Quickstart

Prerequisite: Node.js >= 18.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/lati-club/clista-protocol.git
cd clista-protocol
npm install
npm run clista -- help
```

First successful workflow:

```sh
npm run clista -- validate
npm run clista -- state show
npm run clista -- export
npm run clista -- continuity export --out continuity.json
npm run clista -- continuity verify --packet continuity.json
npm run clista -- release verify --tag v0.30.2-protocol-release
npm run clista -- release manifest --out .clista/release-manifest.json --tag v0.30.2-protocol-release
npm run clista -- runtime verify --manifest .clista/release-manifest.json
npm run clista -- runtime audit --manifest .clista/release-manifest.json
```

Expected outcomes on a fresh clone: every command above exits 0. The two continuity steps
report `resumeStatus: "degraded"` — the bundled origin thread predates v0.24 — and list the
legacy causes in `degradationReasons`. Degraded continuity on this fixture is the documented
boundary, not a broken install.

For the expanded first-run guide and failure triage, see `docs/quickstart.md`.

## The Scenario Demo — Trace a Yes Yourself

```sh
node src/cli.js validate --events examples/scenario-demo/events.ndjson
node src/cli.js state show --thread thd_scenario_demo --events examples/scenario-demo/events.ndjson
node src/cli.js export --events examples/scenario-demo/events.ndjson
node src/cli.js attribution list --thread thd_scenario_demo --events examples/scenario-demo/events.ndjson
node src/cli.js provenance trace dcr_limited_beta --events examples/scenario-demo/events.ndjson
```

Twenty-three events in `examples/scenario-demo/events.ndjson` encode the full deliberation.
The five commands above reconstruct it: validation, the projected decision state, a portable
integrity-checked export, 18 attributions binding every contribution to a participant and
their event-time authority, and a provenance trace from the approved decision
(`dcr_limited_beta`) back through the claims, reviews, and surviving objection to the raw
evidence. Compare what you see against `examples/scenario-demo/expected-state.json` (a compact
summary for manual inspection; there is no comparator command yet).

This replay has been audited externally: a reviewer with no insider knowledge reproduced it
from a clean public checkout — no hidden builder state, no unpublished files, no absolute
local paths. What the replay proves is reproducibility of structure. What it does not prove:
that the decision was good, that the evidence is true, or that anything here is trusted,
approved, or production-ready. Ask the four questions of any year-old decision in your own
organization — *what did we know, what did we assume, who disagreed, who had authority* —
then ask them of `dcr_limited_beta`. That difference is the protocol.

## Success Means

| Command | Success means | Success does not mean |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `validate` | The append-only event log passed validator checks. | Every claim is true or wise. |
| `state show` | Reasoning state reconstructed from events alone. | The transcript is memory or authority. |
| `export` | Projected state serialized portably, integrity-checked. | Trust or approval is granted. |
| `continuity verify` | A continuity packet matches its event log, projection, and hashes. | Context transfer is trusted memory. |
| `release verify` | The release artifact binds source, tag, version, hashes, verifiers. | The release is trusted or approved. |
| `runtime verify` | The local runtime matches an existing release manifest. | Running code is verified by default. |
| `runtime audit` | The documented verification path works for a fresh user. | Anything beyond that path is proven. |
| Scenario demo | One realistic reasoning lifecycle is durable, replayable state. | A product platform exists. |

## Protocol Spine

- Append-only NDJSON event log — the source of truth.
- Deterministic projection — same events, same state, for anyone, no privileged server.
- CLI-first protocol engine — every capability is a verifiable command.

The two load-bearing commands: `clista state show` (if it can reconstruct current reasoning
state from only the log, the spine works) and `clista validate` (if it rejects invalid logs
with event-level errors, the protocol governs state instead of merely projecting it).

The full capability set, by layer — each command verifies one boundary and fails closed:

| Layer | Command | Passing proves |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Integrity | `integrity verify [--strict]` | The log is verifiable history, not just readable data. |
| Continuity (N2) | `continuity export / resume / verify` | A successor resumes settled state from the verified packet without transcript replay — see [N2: Resumption Without Replay](docs/protocol/v0/n2-resumption-without-replay.md). |
| Compatibility | `compatibility verify` | Unsupported state fails closed instead of best-effort accepted. |
| Interoperability | `interoperability verify` | Declared semantics survive transfer; translation isn't reinterpretation. |
| Federation | `federation verify` | External state can be referenced without importing remote authority. |
| Negotiation | `negotiation verify` | Contexts can resolve differences without merging governance. |
| Execution | `execution verify` | Performed action is evidenced under authorized scope — intent ≠ completion. |
| Outcome | `outcome verify` | Observed effect is checked against intended effect — completion ≠ success. |
| Learning | `outcome-learning verify`, `learning review` | Lessons derive from outcomes without rewriting prior rationale or ranking people. |
| Review | `review verify` | Required examination routes without becoming approval. |
| Recovery | `recovery verify` | Trusted projection restores without rewriting or hiding invalid history. |
| Release | `release verify` | The repository artifact is bound and reproducible. |
| Runtime | `runtime verify / audit` | The running code matches a manifest; the documented path works cold. |
| Identity | `identity show` | Roles and authority history reconstruct from the log. |
| Attribution | `attribution list` | Every contribution traces to a participant and event-time authority. |
| Provenance | `provenance verify / trace` | Each contribution's source lineage and transformation are auditable. |
| Adaptation | `adaptation review` | Learning can recommend governance review without mutating governance. |
| Amendment | `amendment verify` | Protocol changes require explicit approval — recommendations don't mutate rules. |

Layer details, event families, and the primitive map: `docs/protocol/v0/`.

## Boundaries — What Green Checks Do Not Mean

This section exists once, on purpose. Every verifier in ClisTa keeps `trusted: false` until
something *outside* the protocol grants trust — verification of structure is never endorsement
of content. The anti-pattern ClisTa refuses to be:

```text
vibes with hashes
```

— a system that hashes artifacts without proving who authored them, under what authority, or
why their contributions should be trusted.

The standing boundary rules, each load-bearing:

- Provenance is not truth ranking. Learning is not reputation. Adaptation is not governance
  mutation. Recommendation is not amendment.
- Continuity is not transcript replay. Compatibility is not best-effort acceptance.
  Federation is not centralization. Negotiation is not authority transfer.
- Execution is not intent. Completion is not success. Learning is not retroactive
  justification. Review is not approval. Recovery is not history rewrite.
- Release is not trust. Runtime verification is not attestation. Layer versions are
  capability boundaries, not release numbers — continuity may honestly report an older
  `protocolVersion` than the package version, because the portability boundary moved less
  recently than the artifact.

This repository is `clista-protocol` — the protocol spine only. UI, agent orchestration, and
platform features are out of scope until the spine has earned them.

### Scope freeze until the gate lifts

The spine is frozen until the EXTERNAL-RUNS gate is decided (`pack/GATES.md`):

- **No new verifier layers until five external runs exist.** Every layer is permanent
  deterministic surface area — once shipped, the determinism guarantee (same events → same
  state) must hold for it forever. Adding layers before the productization claim is tested is
  building on an unverified foundation. The cheapest way to move this project is an external
  run, not a new layer (see *Start here* at the top). This rule lifts when the gate lifts.
- **Frozen-but-supported layers.** Four existing layers are platform-shaped concerns that
  already wear protocol clothes: **amendment, adaptation, learning, negotiation**. They are
  *supported* — their verifiers keep passing, they stay deterministic, and they keep
  `trusted: false` — but *frozen*: no expansion of their event families or rules until the
  gate lifts. They are flagged here so their permanence is a deliberate, recorded choice, not
  drift. They are not removed; removing a shipped layer would break determinism for any log
  that used it.

Bugfixes, docs, tests, and the debate pack are always in scope. New deterministic *layers*
are not, until the runs materialize.

## The Debate Pack (reference)

The call to action is at the top of this README; this section is the reference for what
`pack/` contains. `pack/` is the distributable Stage 0 debate pack: `PROMPT_PACK.md` (roles,
rules, close protocol), `LEDGER_TEMPLATE.md` (the artifact of record), and `RUNBOOK.md` (how
to run an instrumented external run and where to report it, including the `clista run report`
helper). It works with AI agents from any vendor, humans, or both. External runs feed a
public, bidirectional gate (`pack/GATES.md`): if five external runs don't materialize by
2026-09-07, or runs show no advantage, the productization claim dies on the record. Failed
and abandoned runs are explicitly wanted evidence.
